# Plot data [Describe what you see]

# Check if variance is stabilized

# Check if data is stationary [State Ho and H1 and conclude]

# If Not -> Difference data

# Plot differenced data [Describe what you see]

# Check if differenced data is stationary [State Ho and H1 and conclude]

# If Stationary -> Plot ACF and PACF [Describe what you see]

# Identify Model from ACF and PACF [Write model]

# Identify competing models

# Plot residuals [Describe what you see]

# Check for Normality test [State Ho and H1 and conclude]

# Check if model is appropriate [State Ho and H1 and conclude]
